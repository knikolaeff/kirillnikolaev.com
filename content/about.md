### Hello, World!

My name is Kirill (aka Kiryl) and I am trying to become a full-time software developer. I gained some professional experience working as a QA Engineer Intern, but mostly I am a self-taught programmer. 

### Professional interests:
- Linux power user
- Python & WebDev (currently developing REST API using FastAPI + sqlalchemy)
- Data Science (wannabe)
- CyberSec (pentesting, network reconnaissance, reverse engineering, all this kind of stuff)

### Other interests:
- Economics, including cryptocurrency
- Retrogaming and emulation
- Raspberry Pi tinkering
- Hardware/Software troubleshooting (freelanced fixing electronics for people, nobody has complained yet xD) 
- Self-hosted (currently hosting a SearX instance, previously hosted some game servers)
- Decentralization 
- Sci-Fi
