There comes a time in every man's life when he just has to talk about his Linux setup on the internet.

### Why Arch?

I use Arch Linux because I tend to follow the principle "you need something - you install something", not "you don't need something - delete it". Although Arch can be a pain from time to time, I love it's minimalistic philosophy and hackability. 

Moreover, Arch taught me a lot about Linux and gave me that environment and comminity I love to work in. ArchWiki is probably the most comprehensive database of a Linux knowledge and ArchForums, although not as populated as Ubuntu's, are the full of the smartest people I have ever met.

Pacman and AUR are also forever in my heart. 

### Software

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is my terminal emulator. It just works right. Kitty is fast, easily customazable and never let me down. Love this stuff
- [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) is archaic and clunky, but I still like it more than any other WM 
- Firefox is still the best browser ever invented. Full stop.
- Slightly configured Vim for regular text editing, e.g. to change some configs or to write a post for my website
- VSCodium for "real" programming. Not as bloated as other IDEs but yet highly powerful 
- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki) is that fancy bar at the top of my screen
- [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) suffers from the same sort of clunkiness like Openbox, but I still cannot find anything better

### Dotfiles

I am using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage my dotfiles. You can find them at my github repo: https://github.com/knikolaeff/.dotfiles
