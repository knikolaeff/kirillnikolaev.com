## TL;DR 

My public instance with 0-logging policy and convenient default settings:

SearX (or it's fork SearXNG) is a free and open-source metasearch engine. Unlike traditional search engines, SearX:

- **Respects your privacy** by removing private data from search requests, as well as requests going to the result pages
- Searching using multiple (**meta**search) search engines, such as Google, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Wikidata; there are dozens. This gives you much more information and does not trap you in a [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble)
- Hackable. Don't like my defaults? Change anything you like. All changes are stored in your browser cookies and belong to you.
