SearX (or it's fork SearXNG) is a free and open-source metasearch engine. Unlike traditional search engines, SearX:

- **Respects your privacy** by removing private data from search requests, as well as requests going to the result pages
- Searching using multiple (**meta**search) search engines, such as Google, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Wikidata; there are dozens. This gives you much more information and does not trap you in a [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble)
- Hackable. Don't like my defaults? Change anything you like. All changes are stored in your browser cookies and belong to you. 

When creating my own instance, I tried to focus on both usability and privacy. I keep zero logs about your activity, some of the engines were modded for better experience, e.g. Google's engine now uses mobile UI by default to prevent my instance from being banned. 

Try it and tell me what you think :)


**TL;DR**: My public instance with 0-logging policy and convenient default settings:
