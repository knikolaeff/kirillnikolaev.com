### About

Compressio was originally my final college project. 

Ð¡ompressio is a Python-based program that uses the PyQt framework for it's GUI. I also used **multithreading** and **Pillow** libraries It is pretty simple: 
1. Select a folder containing images you need to compress
2. Select where to save all the images after compressing
3. Choose level of compression using a slider. This is applicable only to JPEG, as PNG is a lossless format. 

The coolest thing I'm proud of is compressio's speed. Hundreads of images can be compressed in 10-20 seconds. Furthermore, you will not spot any significant difference in quality.
